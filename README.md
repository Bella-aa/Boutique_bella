## UX Design

* *The UXD was created taking into consideration "The Five Planes"*

### Strategy plane

* Boutique Bella ecommerce store app will act as a website where customers can browse and purchase products or find out more about the business.

### Scope Plane

* The users will be able to create an account. After logging in, they will be able to browse and purchase products/goods for delivery.
* Users who wish to shop with boutique bella will also have the option to checkout as guest customers.

### Structure Plane

* Boutique Bella website will have the following pages - store page, login page, cart page, order summary page and checkout page

### Skeleton Plane

* I did not create any wireframes of this website, as it was scrapped from the walkthrough project Boutique Ado.

### Surface Plane

* The chosen color scheme picked for the website is predominantly white and blue-green with blacck text . 
* The colors of the navigation buttons were chosen to stand out from the main theme to get the attention of the user.
* The color contrast successfullyÂ passes using the [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/) contrast validator.
